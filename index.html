                    <h4>November 22 at 4:13 PM</h4>

                    <p>With the aim of giving life into the realms of fiction, the College of Social Science Student
                        Council (CSS-SC) hosted an engaging program centered around the theme “From Page To Stage: The
                        Art of Characterization” at URSP Campus Gymnasium, Friday, November 17.</p>

                    <p>Prof. Nery T. Vivas, the Campus OSDS Coordinator, described the act of embodying favorite
                        characters as a true art form. According to her, the essence of a perfect cosplay lies in both
                        looking and feeling like the chosen character, emphasizing that a smile can be the most powerful
                        tool in this creative endeavor.</p>

                    <img src="./PICS/newspic2.jpg">

                    <p>The event proved to be a meaningful occasion for students to showcase their artistic skills
                        through the lens of cosplay. Proudly representing various grade levels within the College of
                        Social Science, students brought to life their preferred characters sourced from a diverse range
                        of literary contexts.</p>

                    <p>
                        Reflecting on the significance of the event, Ms. Heleina Altamirano, a BS Psychology III
                        student, shared her perspective: "The CSS event with the theme 'From Page to Stage: The Art of
                        Characterization' empowers me to show my creativity and boost my self-confidence. It allows for
                        a characterization that not only portrays 'someone' but incorporates a touch of our own magic,
                        our own personality. This event helps learners appreciate themselves, the beauty of art, and the
                        literary pieces themselves."
                    </p>
                    <img src="./PICS/newspic3.jpg">

                    <p>
                        Participating in such events involves substantial effort to ensure their success, coupled with
                        overcoming social barriers. In an interview with Ms. Maric Mhaniel Ashley Lacsamana, another
                        student from BS Psychology III, she emphasized, “it helps me to grow and do things beyond my
                        horizon; it allows me to expand and learn, facing new and different people. The importance of
                        the program is the influence it gives to individuals, the experience it offers, and allowing
                        yourself to be happy while accepting new people you've never expected to bond with.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Adding to the perspectives, Ms. Rosette Babon, who secured the 2nd place in the Literary Cosplay
                        Contest, “The activity was enjoyable; everyone in the event was also excited to witness our
                        performances. Also, the emcees were skilled in keeping the audience lively when [they] were
                        tense to do impromptu. Overall, we didn't expect to win and we congratulate all the other
                        contestants and the CSS-SC for the successful activity.”

                    <p>The University of Rizal System Pililla is one of the leading external campuses that provides
                        quality education and training to the youth of Pililla and its neighboring towns. Its existence
                        was conceived because of the growing request from the residents of the Municipality to have
                        their own college institution that could offer affordable and quality education and would
                        primarily cater to the needs of high school graduates of the town. This was realized when Rizal
                        College of Agriculture and Technology (RCAT) was formally opened on May 22, 1991 through the
                        efforts of Former Mayor Nicomedes F. Patenia, Dr. Heracleo D. Lagrada, The President of RCAT and
                        Prof Apolinario F. Masinsin, the first designated Campus Director with the approval of the
                        Mayor, the old municipal building was used as the first school site for almost four years,
                        until, this campus was moved in Sitio Dampol, Brgy. Bagumbayan, Pililla, Rizal.</p>
